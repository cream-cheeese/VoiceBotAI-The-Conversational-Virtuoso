# GPT-3 Voice Interaction Script
This Python script enables users to interact verbally with OpenAI's GPT-3 model. Since GPT-3 itself doesn't support verbal communication, we've integrated Eleven Labs to provide GPT-3 with a voice and microphone for receiving verbal inputs. The user's spoken input is recorded, transcribed, processed by GPT-3, and the resulting output is made audible using Eleven Labs.
Great! Let's proceed with the **Installation** section of your README. This section will guide users on how to install any necessary dependencies and set up their environment to run your Python script.
